I am Yohanna Agatha Bertha Sihombing, a Software Engineering Technology student with a high passion to continue learning and developing in the world of technology. My great interest in web development drives me to focus on exploring various aspects, from front-end to back-end, as well as user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design. As someone who has the ability as a Full Stack Developer, I master various front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, which allow me to create attractive and interactive web interfaces. On the back-end side, I use Node.js and MySQL to build robust and efficient web applications. In addition, my understanding of UI/UX Design principles allows me to design applications that are not only functional, but also provide an optimal user experience. I believe that technology has the potential to change the world, and I am motivated to continue honing my skills and contributing to innovative projects that can have a positive impact. I am always looking for new challenges and collaborating with people who share the same passion.
